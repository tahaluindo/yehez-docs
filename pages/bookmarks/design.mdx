## Self Introduction
My name is Mari Capone and I am junior at Lehigh University studying journalism and marketing. I am originally from outside of Boston, MA, but recently moved to live full-time on Cape Cod. I have a 23-year-old brother who graduated from Lehigh last year and is currently at law school. At home, I live with my parents and golden retriever named Cooper. 

I will be using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for my data journalism class this semester.

## Comic
I made this comic using [Pixton](https://www.pixton.com/).

## Undergraduate Enrollment Infographic
This is an infographic created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) with data from the [Office of Institutional Research & Strategy Analysis](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf). The infographic that shows the Lehigh University's student enrollment data as of Fall 2019. The infographic shows that the college of Arts & Sciences had the highest enrollment, followed by Engineering and Appl. Sci and Business. The total student enrollement was just over 5,000 students, which has increased by almost 2,000 students since 2019.

## Lehigh University Applicants vs. Enrolled Students Chart
I created this chart using [Chartbuilder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/). The chart shows the number of applicants and the number of undergraduate student enrollment over the past 5 years at Lehigh University. I received this data from the [Office of Institutional Reseach & Strategy Analytics](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/university-profile) and [The Brown & White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2022/04/10/acceptance-rate-decreases-for-class-of-2026/). The chart shows that Lehigh is slowly increasing undergraduate enrollment. After a drop in applicants during the pandemic year, 2020, the number of Lehigh applicants is increasing and approaching the previously higher numbers of applications from 2018 and 2019.

## College Enrollment per Year Chart
I created this chart using [Chartbuilder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/) with data from the  [Office of Institutional Reseach & Strategy Analytics](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/university-profile). This is a time-series chart that shows the changes in percent of undergraduate enrollment per college year. Enrollment in College of Arts & Sciences is gradually increasing, while enrollment for the College of Engineering decreases each year. Enrollment in the College of Business remains similar each year.

## Most Used Social Media Platforms Infographic
This is an infographic created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) with data from the [Search Engine Journal](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/social-media/biggest-social-media-sites/#close). This infographic shows the most used social media platforms in 2022, including the amount of monthly active users (MAUs) and total revenue for each application. Facebook is the most popular platform, with the highest amount of MAUs and greatest revenue by over $50 billion. It is interesting to note that WhatsApp and Instagram have the same amount of MAUs, yet Instagram's revenue is almost $20 billion more.

## Le-Lef Football Timeline
I created this timeline using [TimlineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html#make) with data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rivalry_(Lafayette%E2%80%93Lehigh)). The timeline depicts milestones from the Lehigh-Lafayette football rivalry, which is the most played football rivalry in America. The rivalry includes a streak of 124 uninterrupted games, only broken by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

## Evolution of Cameras Timeline
I created a timeline using [TimlineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html#make) with data from [Inventionland](https://inventionland.com/blog/the-evolution-of-cameras/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_camera). The timeline depicts the evolution of the camera, excluding information from after the first digital camera was invented. It's interesting to note that the first partial photograph was created as far back as 1816, and the first digital camera was invented in 1988.

## US Unemployment Rate Chart
I created this chart using [Chartbuilder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/) with data from [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/unemployment-rate#:~:text=U.S.%20unemployment%20rate%20for%202021,a%200.46%25%20decline%20from%202017.). The chart shows the changes in the US unemployment rate over the past 10 years. It's interesting to note how the unemployment rate is decreasing until 2020, and then spikes during the year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Top 20 Cycling Cities in the World 2019
I created this map using [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/) and data from [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/most-bike-friendly-cities-2019-copenhagenize-design-index/). This map shows the Top 20 Cycling Cities in the world as of 2019. The top cycling city is Copenhagen, Denmark, followed by Amterdam and Utrecht, Netherlands.

## Most Visited Cities in the World 2022
I created this map using [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/) with data from [One Step 4ward](https://onestep4ward.com/most-visited-cities-in-the-world/). The map shows the Top 10 Most Visited Cities in the World as of 2022. The most visited city is Bangkok, Thailand. The only city on the list in North America is New York City.

## Party Location and Group Involvement Dashboard
I created this dashboard using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) with data from Lehigh's 2016 [Party Location Survery](https://coursesite.lehigh.edu/pluginfile.php/6023080/course/section/4143089/Lehigh%20Party%20Scene%20Survey.pdf). The first chart shows which party location is preferred by different groups on campus - Greek life, Athletics, Greek Life & Athletics, Neither. The second chart shows the percent of groups on campus that have attented a party on "The Hill." In both charts, Greek life has the highest involvement, especially for attending parties on "The Hill" where fraternity and sorority houses are.

## US Poverty and Unployment Data 2022
I created these visualizations using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover). These visualizations show the poverty and unemployment rate in each US state as of 2022, along with the specific number of people living in poverty. These visualizations were created using data from [The World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/poverty-rate-by-state) and [The US Bureau of Labors Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm). The states with the highest poverty rates are Mississippi, Louisiana, and New Mexico, which are all over 17%, but these states don't necessarily have the highest unemployment rate. Despite having a mid-level poverty rate compared to other states, Illinois has the highest unemployment rate at 4.5%. The number of people living in poverty varies in each state depending on the population.
